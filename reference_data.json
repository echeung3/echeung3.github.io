A1C of *** -- sugars >200 have been shown to delay gastric emptying. - Trial prokinetic agents: metoclopramide, erythromycin (more appropriate for short term use) - Can consider gastric electrical stimulation in outpatient setting - Consider domperidone - Consider centrally acting antidepressants - Mirtazapine 7.5 mg q HS (caution with concurrent SSRI) - Second line approaches include venting gastrostomy, feeding jejunostomy Secondary to diabetes. A gastric emptying scan was diagnostic of gastroparesis in *  Ddx includes rumination syndrome, eating disorders, cannabinoid induced hyperemesis, cyclic vomiting syndrome, GERD, gastric outlet obstruction etc. Prior work up includes EGD done in *. Patient was previously treated with reglan, zofran, compazine* This patient has had frequent admissions and exacerbations likely triggered by uncontrolled diabetes* and opioid medications. This patients BMI is currently *. - Markedly uncontrolled ( > 200 mg / dl) glucose levels may aggravate symptoms of gastroparesis and delay gastric emptying. Optimization of glycemic control should be a target for therapy; this may improve symptoms and the delayed gastric emptying. - Medication-induced delay in gastric emptying, particularly from narcotics and anticholinergic agents and glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and amylin analogs should be stopped. - The first line of management for gastroparesis patients should include restoration of fluids and electrolytes, nutritional support and in diabetics, optimization of glycemic control. - Oral intake is preferable for nutrition and hydration. Patients should receive counseling from a dietician regarding consumption of a \"gastroparesis diet\": frequent small volume nutrient meals that are low in fat and soluble fiber. If unable to tolerate solid food, then use of homogenized or liquid nutrient meals is recommended. -Oral intake is the preferable route for nutrition and hydration. If oral intake is insufficient, then enteral alimentation by jejunostomy tube feeding should be pursued (after a trial of nasoenteric tube feeding). Indications for enteral nutrition include unintentional loss of 10 % or more of the usual bodyweight during a period of 3 =E2=80=93 6 months, and / or repeated hospitalizations for refractory symptoms. - For enteral alimentation, postpyloric feeding is preferable to gastric feeding because gastric delivery can be associated with erratic nutritional support. - Check EKG to measure QTc - Metoclopramide is the first line of prokinetic therapy and should be administered at the lowest effective dose in a liquid formation to facilitate absorption. The risk of tardive dyskinesia has been estimated to be < 1% but may be irreversable, there is a black box warning for this. Patients should be instructed to discontinue therapy if they develop side effects including involuntary movements. - Reglan 5=E2=80=9310 mg AC BID-TID can start with IV and transition to PO - Erythromycin improves gastric emptying and symptoms from delayed gastric emptying. Administration of intravenous (IV) erythromycin should be considered when IV prokinetic therapy is needed in hospitalized patients. (Erythromycin 250=E2=80=93500 mg ac t.i.d.) - Schedule antiemetics around the clock - We do not offer gastric electrical stimulators at UCI, the patient will need to follow up at another center as an outpatient for this",

Additionally, there is no epidermal detachment nor mucosal, genital, or ophthalmologic involvement to suggest SJS/TEN. - These types of uncomplicated morbilliform eruptions usually occur 5- 14 days after medication initiation.

The most common causes are: antibiotics, NSAIDs, opioids, and diuretics (such as furosemide). - Reviewed chart and previous MAR (from prior admission). During stay, patient was started on NORCO. This is a likely agent to cause the rash. No NSAIDS or antibiotics were given.  Home furosemide was discontinued. Due to the timeline, with NORCO being given on 2/11, this is the favored cause; however, unable to definitely say. - Despite this rash occurring 2/2 to a presumed medication, the patient can continue his medications if needed. - ~80% of morbilliform drug eruptions resolve within 2 weeks.

Chronic complications include chronic pain, anemia, neuro deficits, seizures, pulmonary conditions, renal impairment, osteoporosis, cardiomyopathy with diastolic dysfunction, hepatotoxicity due to transfusions and medications, reduced growth, chronic leg ulcers, proliferative retinopathy. However, patients with chronic hemolysis (such as sickle cell anemia) who depend on increased erythrocyte production can have significant anemia with a decreased reticulocyte count. - Heme/onc consult to discuss allogenic BMT given curative potential. - Discuss hydroxyurea given ability to prolong life expectancy (increase fetal hemoglobin levels and generate nitric oxide) -- would be appropriate given *** frequent pain crises, severe symptomatic anemia, or previous acute chest syndrome or stroke #vaso-occlusive events Opiates are the preferred analgesic, with the exception of meperidine, which can cause seizures.

Patients undergoing surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia should receive PRBC transfusion for a target hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL (100 g/L) to avoid surgical complications. Monthly transfusions (hypertransfusion) in patients with an initial stroke can reduce the incidence of subsequent stroke and reduce stroke occurrence in patients at risk for stroke based on cranial Doppler arterial velocity. With any transfusion, care should be taken to keep hemoglobin concentrations less than 10 g/dL (100 g/L) to avoid problems with blood hyperviscosity.",

You can have one serving of dairy on the side. Refer to ChooseMyPlate.gov. Other options include meal replacements such as Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, SmartOne, or Lean Cuisine. Your daily calorie goal should be to reduce to 1200-1300 calories a day 2. Try intermittent fasting The 16/8 method: Also called the Leangains protocol, it involves skipping breakfast and restricting your daily eating period to 8 hours, such as 11 am - 7 pm. Then you fast for 16 hours in between. 3. Try meal replacements. You can try to drink a protein shake such as a Premier Shake or SlimFast for lunch after your intermittent fasting ends. 4. The largest source of excess calories is from liquid calories. Examples are soda, alcohol, juice, milk. Try and reduce and eventually eliminate these. Instead try to drink at least 2-2.5 liters or 67-84oz of water a day. 5. Try to limit carbohydrate intake. Examples are white rice, potatoes, pasta, bread, french fries, chips. These have a high glycemic index which means they will make your blood sugar high quickly and also plummet quickly. This drop will make you hungry again more quickly. 6. Decrease desserts. Try snacking on vegetables like microwaved frozen peas before your meals to limit your hunger and as a source of fiber to trap cholesterol, or as a snack if you are craving desserts. 7. Increase servings of vegetables and fruits. Goal is 6-7 servings a day 8. Besides diet modifications, try to exercise 30 minutes daily at least 5 times a week. You can try walking, swimming, or even biking. Your step goal should be around 8000 a day. 9. Please call weight management at UCI for a free class (949-824-8770) 10. Try downloading Noom -- an app that helps with counseling to reduce appetite. 11. Alli (orlistat) is an over the counter medication you can purchase. You can take 2 pills (120 mg) with your main meals to prevent fat absorption. It can cause diarrhea with fatty meals. If you take this, make sure you take a multivitamin at night to make sure you are getting enough vitamins. 12. If you are diabetic or prediabetic, consider starting metformin, liraglutide (Victoza), semaglutide (GLP1) for added weight loss. 13. Talk to your doctor to see if you qualify for Qsymia or Phentermine 14. If your BMI >40 or if you have comorbidities like OSA and HTN and you have a BMI >35, ask your doctor about bariatric surgery. Sleeve gastrectomy is accomplished by excising the part of the stomach along the greater curvature, creating an approximately 85% reduction in size; similar to gastric bypass, it results in restriction of calorie intake via a smaller stomach and hormonal (GLP-1 and related hormones) appetite suppression. The smaller gastric surface area also results in less production of ghrelin, an appetite stimulant.",
