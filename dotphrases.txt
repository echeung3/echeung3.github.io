DOTPHRASE AMA 

Called by bedside RN that @M@ @LNAME@ wants to leave AMA. I discussed the purpose of @HIS@ hospitalization, including the risks and benefits of staying in the hospital. @CAPHE@ was able to communicate a consistent choice, understanding of @HIS@ illness and recommended treatment, the risks and benefits of treatment, and a consistent rationale behind @HIS@ choice to leave the hospital. @CAPHE@ verbalized understanding that if @HE@ leaves the hospital, @HE@ would not be able to get appropriate treatment and that death is a possibility. @CAPHE@ stated the reason for @HIS@ urgent leaving of the hospital was ***. There were no verbalizations of thoughts of self-harm or harm to others. I feel that @HE@ understood the risks and benefits of staying in the hospital and could weigh @HIS@ decision, so @HE@ had capacity. No acute indication for 5150. Security was not called. We offered to sign the AMA form, and @HE@ did***. @CAPHE@ left the floor safely.


There may be questions regarding this patient's capacity to make certain decisions including leaving AMA. All physicians are capable of making basic capacity assessments, although psychiatry is available to assist and offer a second opinion whenever needed. 

If a patient is demanding to leave AMA without having demonstrated capacity, UCI police should be involved and informed that the patient "does not have capacity." A 5150 is not required.
For a patient to have capacity to make a decision, they must demonstrate an ability to: 

1. Communicate a choice and consistently stick with that choice 
2. Communicate understanding and convey back the relevant information about their illness and the procedure/treatment recommended. 
3. Communicate understanding of the risks/benefits of the procedure/treatment and also of not having it done. 
4. Communicate the rationale behind their choice.

DOTPHRASE Agent Selection 
(Avoid mixing AV nodal blocking classes due to risk of complete block, but can add digoxin as a secondary agent if poor control with primary agent)
- Diltiazem (avoid in systolic heart failure)
- Beta-blocker (avoid in reactive airway disease, favor in hyperthyroid)
- Digoxin (not for acute control, 2 hour onset. Favor in heart failure)
- None of the above if WPW / accessory pathway (consider cardioversion, ablation, or anti-arrhythmic instead) as it slows conduction through AV node which can increase anterograde conduction through accessory pathway}

MELD-Na
Child-Pugh 
(ranges from 5-15. 5-6 = class A / well-compensated. 10% mortality rate from abdominal surgery, 100% one year survival rate. 7-9 = class B / significant functional compromise. 30% mortality rate from abdominal surgery, 80% one year survival rate. 10-15 = class C / decompensated cirrhosis. 82% mortality rate from abdominal surgery, 45% one year survival rate)
Median survival <6 months in decompensated cirrhosis + Child-Pugh >12 or MELD >21 (18 if hospitalized for liver-related illness)
MAP <82 predicts 20% survival at 24 months and 0% survival at 48 months (compared to 70% and 50% for MAP >82)

Triggers to consider before assuming medication non-adherence: Fluid (increased total body, decreased intravascular), infection (UA, urine microscopy, CXR, BCx, paracentesis), bleed (CBC)
Another paradigm: Medication non-adherence, infection, increased generation of ammonia (bleed, overdiuresis, volume depletion, AKI), decreased clearance of ammonia (TIPS, portal vein thrombosis, HCC, alcoholic hepatitis), electrolyte disturbance, toxin

Hepatic encephalopathy
- Lactulose titrated to 2-3BM/day, Rifaximin 550mg PO bid, Zinc SO4 200mg PO daily
- Screen for (infectious) trigger: UA, Blood Cx, paracentesis, r/o dehydration / overdiuresis

Ascites
- Furosemide 40mg PO : Spironolactone 100mg PO
- Therapeutic paracentesis, replete 25g albumin per 4L removed
- Consider hold or half beta blocker variceal prophylaxis 

DOTPHRASE Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
Paracentesis with >250 PMN or positive culture
- Ceftriaxone 1g IV daily -> ciprofloxacin 500mg PO daily or TMP/SMX DS PO bid x1 week
- Albumin 1.5g/kg body weight within 6 hours of detecting SBP and 1.0g/kg on day 3 may help short-term survival/renal function per Albumin for SBP (1999)
  (Use if high risk: Cr>1, BUN>30, or TBili >4) 
- Permanently discontinue nonselective beta blockers (decreased transplant-free survival, increased rates of hepatorenal syndrome, and more days of hospitalization)

DOTPHRASE SBP prophylaxis
? Hx prior SBP or ascites albumin <1.5 with renal/liver impairment (Cr>1.2, BUN>25, Na<130, Childs-Pugh>9, Bili >3) or ascitic albumin <1.5 and currently hospitalized
- Ciprofloxacin 500mg PO daily vs. TMP/SMX DS 1 tab PO daily?  Ciprofloxacin 750mg PO weekly sometimes used (but may select for resistant organisms).  VA recommends cefpodoxime given high rates of Cipro resistance

DOTPHRASE Varices (Bleed): 
Octreotide 50mcg bolus followed by 50mcg/hr gtt acutely, transition to Propranolol 20mg PO bid or Nadolol 20mg PO daily after stabilization with goal HR <70
Antibiotic prophylaxis for week after bleed (ceftriaxone 1g IV daily while inpatient, transition to norfloxacin 400mg or ciprofloxacin 500mg PO bid upon discharge)
Hepatology 2005;41:572

DOTPHRASE Hepatorenal syndrome? (Type I: Rapidly progressive over days.  Type II: "Diuretic refractory ascites")
- 1g/kg/day albumin challenge x2 days to confirm not pre-renal (if improves, this is hypovolemic renal failure. If fails to improve, HRS)
- Midodrine (7.5-12.5mg PO tid) + Octreotide (100-200mcg SubQ tid) + 20-40g/d albumin, goal increase MAP 15mmHg, but really only liver transplant will help at this point
Hepatology 1999;29:1690

DOTPHRASE Coagulopathy / "Chronic DIC"
Elevated INR is actually misleading, patient missing both pro- and anti-coagulant factors, and should receive VTE prophylaxis (heparin) if Plt>50
- For purposes of procedure (i.e., paracentesis), can administer FFP, platelets, cryoprecipitate respectively (goal INR<2, Plt>50, fibrinogen>100), but no data to support.  Can't really avoid bleed risks (though minimal for paracentesis anyway).
Hepatology 2004;40;484

DOTPHRASE Compensated cirrhosis (outpatient)
- q6month RUQ ultrasound for HCC monitoring if cirrhosis or Hepatitis B+
- EGD (repeat every 3 years if no varices)
- Check Hep C genotype + viral load to guide potential therapy
- Hep A/B vaccination series
- Counsel on EtOH cessation

{- ASA 325mg load + ticagrelor 180mg load or clopidogrel 600mg (if cath planned), 300mg (if no cath)
- Then ASA 81 daily + ticagrelor 90mg bid or clopidogrel 75mg daily
- Hold second antiplatelet if suspicious of multi-vessel disease or need for CABG as needs to wait 5 days to washout if given
- Continue DAPT >30 days for BMS, >1 year for DES
- Atorvastatin 80mg PO daily (or rosuvastatin 40mg), check lipid panel 
- Anti-coagulation (heparin drip per ACS protocol) vs (enoxaparin if planning medical management only, slightly superior as per ESSENCE, more appropriate if Low Risk TIMI <=2, but ask interventional first as they usually prefer reversible and monitorable heparin). Continue until catheterization or at least 48hrs if only medical management
- Consider beta-blocker: metoprolol 12.5mg PO bid (titrate to goal Hr<70). Hold if SBP <90 / cardiogenic shock (may worsen near-term mortality from shock, especially if use IV. Start prior to discharge)
- NTG + morphine PRN chest pain or NTG drip if ongoing chest pain (hold if hypotensive / cardiogenic shock / inferior MI / sildenafil within past 24 hours)

High Risk TIMI >=3: favor GP IIb/IIIa and early angiography
- Consider GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (e.g., eptifibatide) if ongoing chest pain, elevated troponin on presentation, heart failure, diabetes or otherwise planning early angiography (within 24-48hrs), but only helps if actually getting catheterization and per ACUITY and EARLY, same effect if wait until just prior to PCI, so usually defer to interventional cardiology (continue until catheterization, then 6-12 hours)

Prior to Discharge (core measures)
- Assess LV Function (i.e., TTEcho)
- ACE-I / ARB if EF<40% (though GISSI-3 indicates can help regardless of EF)

1. Cardiac Risk Stratification
?	Revised Cardiac Risk Index = ***, conferring a Class *** risk and a ***% risk of major cardiac event
?	Gupta Perioperative Risk = ***, conferring a ***% risk of MI or cardiac arrest
?	Estimated Functional Capacity = *** METs 
The planned surgery is *** and it is *** {emergent/urgent/elective}. The patient does {not} have any active cardiac conditions that would preclude {him/her} from surgery as defined by the American College of Cardiology such as unstable ACS, recent MI (<6 weeks), decompensated CHF, life-threatening arrhythmias, or severe valvular disease. The patient has {good/fair/poor} functional capacity as defined by attainable METs. Stress testing is NOT indicated based on lack of cardiac symptoms and adequate functional capacity. Major risk factors include: {CVA, CAD, CHF, DM, renal insufficiency with Cr > 2}, which our patient exhibits ***. The surgery-specific risk of cardiac death or nonfatal MI is {high >5% risk / intermediate 1-5% risk / low <1% risk}. Heart rate control with a beta blocker should be {continued/started}. 
- Avoid cessation of low dose aspirin therapy used for secondary prevention (associated with three-fold increase in adverse cardiac events, 90-fold increase if stents are present)
- Continue statin therapy
- Beta blocker therapy should be initiated at least 2-4 weeks prior to surgery and titrated to heart rate 55-65
- Hold ACEi/ARB on day of surgery unless patient has history of heart failure***
- EKG in patients with cardiac disease (except in low-risk surgery) to have baseline should a posteperative test be abnormal
- Otherwise, the patient should proceed to surgery without further risk factor modification

Surgery specific risk factors include {ROS ENDO:300069::"surgical site (thoracic and upper abdominal have most risk, also head and neck and major vascular procedures)","surgery > 3 hours","general anesthesia","emergency surgery"}. ARISCAT score is ***, indicating {ROS ENDO:300069::"low risk (1.6% risk of in hospital post-op pulmonary complications)","intermediate risk (13.3% risk of in hospital post-op pulmonary complications)","high risk (42.1% risk of in hospital post-op pulmonary complications)"}. Patient with ASA {ASA Status REQUIRED:11046}.

Risk factors for MDR (in past 3 months): positive MDR urinary culture, inpatient stay at healthcare facility or nursing home, antibiotics, international travel to area with high rate of MDR (Spain, Mexico, India, Israel)

Inpatient for acute complicated UTI:
- Ceftriaxone 1g daily (2g daily if septic) then narrow as appropriate (10-14d total for beta-lactam, 7-10d total for TMP-SMX, 5-7d total for fluoroquinolone)  
- If risk factors for Pseudomonas, cefepime 1-2g q12h (2g q8h if septic) then narrow as appropriate.
- If risk factors for MDR, meropenem 1g q8h or piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375g q6h.
- If critically ill, obtain additional abdominal/pelvic imaging (CT with/without contrast or renal US) AND add vancomycin. Consider urologic consultation especially if suspected obstruction.

Outpatient for acute complicated UTI: 
- Ciprofloxacin 500mg bid x 5-7d or levofloxacin 750mg daily x 5-7d. 
- If E. coli fluoroquinolone resistance >10%, then ceftriaxone 1g IV/IM (or ertapenem/gentamicin/tobramicin) once then ciprofloxacin 500mg bid x 5-7d or levofloxacin 750mg daily x 5-7d. 
- If can't take fluoroquinolones, then ceftriaxone 1g IV/IM (or ertapenem/gentamicin/tobramicin) once then TMP-SMX DS bid x 7-10d, augmentin 875mg bid x 10-14d, or cefpodoxime 200mg bid x 10-14d. 
- If risk factors for MDR, then ertapenem 1g IV/IM once then ciprofloxacin 500mg bid x 5-7d or levofloxacin 750mg daily x 5-7d.

Outpatient for acute simple cystitis: 
- Nitrofurantoin 100mg bid x 5-7d (okay in older women with mild renal impairment, but avoid if GFR <30), TMP-SMX DS bid x 3-7d (slightly higher rates of resistance), fosfomycin 3g powder x1 dose (generally reserved for MDR infections). 
- If can't, then augmentin 500mg bid x 5-7d, cefpodoxime 100mg bid x 5-7d, cephalexin 250-500mg QID x 5-7d. 
- If can't, then ciprofloxacin 250mg bid x 3d or levofloxacin 250mg daily x 3d.

UTIs in men no longer considered complicated if no signs of infection extending past the bladder (fever, flank pain, CVA tenderness). If positive pelvic/perineal pain, pain radiating to tip of penis, obstructive symptoms such as dribbling/hesitancy, consider prostatitis which WOULD be complicated and warrants treatment with fluoroquinolone. Also get G/C testing in sexually active men. Patients with underlying urologic abnormalities, immunocompromised states, or poorly controlled diabetes are also no longer automatically considered complicated.}

Other special instructions:  
{NVL OTHER SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:211209}

Infection with coronavirus would complicate and will likely postpone your surgery.  
The best way to minimize your chance of infection is physical distancing.  
Physical distancing means putting space between you and other people. The recommended distance is 6 feet, or about 2 meters. This means staying away from any place where people may gather, such as parks or other public gathering places. Physical distancing is the best way to reduce the spread of COVID-19. 
If you do go out, wear a mask.  Wash your hands often with soap and water. Don’t touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. If you can’t wash, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

  - IV diureses >1L negative per day until approach euvolemia/worsening renal function.
  - If diuresis isn't working, may need ionotropic support with dobutamine otherwise Cr will increase, and if that doesn't work, may need RHC
- Inotropic Support: 
  - Hold beta-blockers if patient has cardiogenic shock
  - Digoxin (Beware if renal impairment.  Use minimal effective dose, levels only for toxicity) - (IV inotropes for palliative, or SNF)
  - Dobutamine or milrinone for acute cardiogenic shock / low-output failure
- Devices: ICD or BiV-ICD, if indicated
- Low salt diet, monitor weight
- Aggressive electrolyte repletion (K>4.5, Mg>2)
- avoid CCB's (decrease contractility) and NSAIDS
- CHF Teaching, Home Telehealth, etc.
- Close follow-up in clinic (withing 1 week, 2-3 weeks) with repeat BMP within a week

- Considered Chaga's as a potential etiology given travel Hx as chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy can present many years later with progression rates of 1.9% from indeterminate disease and 4.6% from acute disease. Confirmation would require 2 positive serologic tests, however, per the BENEFIT trial advanced CCC did not show any halt in cardiac progression with anti-trypanosomal therapy only reduction in parasitemia which in our pt would not change current management. 

DOTPHRASE DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS
Signs and symptoms suggestive of DKA with a glucose level that peaked at ***, notable urinary ketones and an elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate level of ***. Etiology unclear, though most likely precipitated by poor insulin administration adherence. Less likely to be infectious/sepsis, MI, CVA, pancreatitis, cocaine, or medications (glucocorticoids, higher-dose thiazide diuretics, sympathomimetic agents, atypical antipsychotics). Patient is status ***L NS, now on maintenance 1/2NS at *** cc/hr given Na > 135 or NS at *** given Na < 135. Patient s/p bolus of 0.1U/kg regular insulin, now on insulin gtt with goal linear decline of 50mg/dL per hour. If not at goal, will plan on doubling current dose of insulin otherwise if overcorrect, will decrease rate by 25%. When anion-gap closes, HCO3 > 15, and glucose < 250, will plan on giving a dose of basal insulin and recheck BMP 4-hours post-administration. If continues to meet all 3 criteria will discontinue insulin gtt. Will consider feeding patient when tolerating oral diet without nausea or vomiting.
- Continue Insulin gtt at *** cc/hr, titrating to a linear decline of 50mg/dL per hour
- Continue maintenance fluids at *** cc/hr
- Monitor Glucose Q1H Glucose level
- Monitor BMP Q2H
- F/u HA1c
- Consider repleting K if < 5.3
- Consider HCO pushes of gtt if pH < 6.8
- Consider carb-controlled diet once tolerating orals

DOTPHRASE Diabetic ketoacidosis / Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome

WORKUP:
-CBC, BMP + Phos
-UA, beta-hydroxybutyrate (assess for presence of ketones)
-Serum osmolality
-ABG/VBG to assess severity of acidemia

TRIGGER ASSESSMENT:
-CXR, UA, blood cultures for infection
-Troponin, EKG for ischemia
-Lipase for pancreatitis

TREATMENT:
-Insulin (regular) 0.1 u/kg (~10 units) IV x1
-Insulin drip, DKA protocol
-Isotonic fluids (NS or LR) bolus 1 L/hr until euvolemic
(expect extensive volume depletion; may require 5 L or more)
-Foley catheter for high urine output monitoring
-Consider arterial or central line for repeated labs
-Treat any underlying causes
-Glucose checks q1h to titrate insulin
-Lab monitoring q2–4h: BMP + phosphorus + pH (ABG/VBG)

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
If pH < 6.9, consider D5W + 100 mEq NaHCO3 IV fluids for a few hours
Maintenance fluids: 1/2 NS at ~200 mL/hr
	-Change to D5 1/2 NS when glucose < 250
	-Change to D5 1/2 NS + 20–40 mEq KCl when urine output demonstrated and K < 5.5
		-If K < 3.5, aggressively replete potassium and hold insulin for a couple hours until K > 4

	-Replete phosphorus with KPhos 20–40 mmol if phosphorus severely low <1
(less evidence)
-Goal: normalize anion gap (eliminate beta-hydroxybutyrate/ketones) due to insulin deficiency (expect glucose and potassium repletion)

TRANSITION OFF INSULIN DRIP:
When anion gap is normalized and insulin requirements are low and stable for 4 hours:
-Calculate/extrapolate 24-hour insulin requirement & Use 75–80% of that total, split between basal and bolus dosing
-Start long-acting insulin, then stop drip 2–3 hours AFTER to bridge effect
-Stop IV fluids and start carb-controlled diet

DOTPHRASE Brief Preop Evaluation
Preoperative Cardiac Risk Asessment for *** surgery: According to the 2014 ACC/AHA guidelines for preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment, risk of perioperative cardiac morbidity should be estimated with the Revised Cardiac Risk Index which includes 6 predictors: high risk surgery (intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular surgery), ischemic heart disease, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal insufficiency with Cr >2, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.  @M@ @LNAME@ has a score of *** which is associated with a low (<1%)/elevated (***%) risk of MACE. No active cardiac conditions such as unstable angina, recent MI, decompensated heart failure, unstable arrhythmias, or severe valvular disease. Functional capacity is ***>***< 4 METS. In summary, he/she is a *** risk patient going for a *** risk surgery.   @CAPHE@ may proceed to surgery without further testing because further testing will not impact decision-making or perioperative care. We recommend the following for management of her perioperative cardiovascular risk: 1) Continue all antihypertensive/antianginal medications perioperatively 2) Continue/hold*** aspirin as she has a/no*** history of coronary stents.  Resume aspirin postoperatively if no active bleeding. 


DOTPHRASE AUDPLAN

- Average number of alcoholic drinks per week: ***
- Duration of alcohol use (years): ***
- Longest sober: *** 

========================
Alcohol Withdrawal (CIWA-Ar)
========================
- CIWA-Ar monitoring initiated as indicated
- Severity stratification:
  - CIWA-Ar <8: Mild withdrawal → supportive care only (no scheduled benzodiazepines)
  - CIWA-Ar 8–15: Moderate withdrawal → symptom-triggered benzodiazepines per CIWA protocol
  - CIWA-Ar ≥16: Severe withdrawal → scheduled benzodiazepines ± escalation to ICU-level care
- Benzodiazepines and/or barbiturates administered per institutional protocol
- Thiamine administered prior to glucose-containing fluids to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy

========================
Pharmacotherapy for Alcohol Use Disorder
========================
- Discussed evidence-based pharmacologic treatment options for AUD with patient per guidelines:

------------------------
Naltrexone (First-line)
------------------------
Eligibility criteria:
- No current opioid use or opioid withdrawal
- Negative UDS for opioids
- No acute hepatitis
- No severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C)
- AST/ALT ≤3–5x upper limit of normal

Liver disease considerations:
- Stable chronic liver disease (including compensated cirrhosis) is NOT a contraindication
- Naltrexone is preferred over acamprosate when hepatic function is stable due to improved tolerability and adherence

Prescription:
- ☐ Naltrexone 50 mg PO daily prescribed

------------------------
Acamprosate (Alternative)
------------------------
Renal function–based dosing (per VA/ASAM):
- CrCl ≥50 mL/min → 666 mg PO TID
- CrCl 30–50 mL/min → 333 mg PO TID (dose-reduced)
- CrCl <30 mL/min → CONTRAINDICATED

Weight-based consideration:
- Weight <60 kg → consider 333 mg PO TID

Prescription:
- ☐ Acamprosate 666 mg PO TID prescribed
- ☐ Acamprosate 333 mg PO TID prescribed (renal function or low body weight)

========================
Medication Decision
========================
- ☐ Pharmacotherapy initiated as above
- ☐ Patient declined pharmacotherapy after counseling (reason documented)
- ☐ Pharmacotherapy deferred (reason documented)

========================
Counseling
========================
- Patient counseled extensively on:
  - Abstinence from alcohol while on pharmacotherapy
  - Expected benefits (reduced cravings, relapse prevention)
  - Common adverse effects and warning signs
- Risks, benefits, and alternatives reviewed; patient expressed understanding

========================
Care Coordination & Discharge Planning
========================
- Ambulatory Clinical Pharmacist consulted. 
- Plan for close outpatient follow-up with PCP within 7 days of discharge
- Discharge coordinator to assist with continuity of AUD treatment

DOTPHRASE # Tobacco Use Disorder / Smoking Cessation
- Assessed readiness to quit using 5 A’s (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange); discussed health risks and benefits of cessation.
- Counseling provided (motivational interviewing); advised complete abstinence and set quit date if willing.
- Pharmacotherapy discussed: NRT (patch + lozenge/gum PRN), varenicline, or bupropion (reviewed contraindications and side effects).
- Offered behavioral support and referral to counseling; provided 1-800-QUIT-NOW and text/online resources.
- Will follow up to reassess readiness, adherence, and adverse effects; document tobacco status at each visit.

DOTPHRASE # Asthma – Outpatient Management
- Dx: Asthma with variable respiratory symptoms (wheeze, SOB, cough, chest tightness) and airflow limitation; assess control (daytime sx, night awakenings, reliever use, activity limitation) and exacerbation risk.
- Severity/Control: Intermittent vs persistent (mild/mod/severe); review triggers (allergens, URI, exercise, GERD, smoking), inhaler technique, and adherence.
- Controller (Preferred – SMART/GINA Track 1): ICS–formoterol as both maintenance + reliever.
   • Step 1–2: PRN low-dose ICS–formoterol
   • Step 3: Daily low-dose ICS–formoterol + PRN
   • Step 4: Daily medium-dose ICS–formoterol + PRN
- Alternative (Track 2 if SMART not feasible): Daily ICS (± LABA) with SABA reliever; avoid SABA-only therapy.
- Reliever: ICS–formoterol preferred; SABA only if not on SMART.
- Add-ons (if uncontrolled): LAMA, ↑ ICS dose, assess phenotype (eosinophilic/allergic), consider biologics (Step 5).
- Monitoring: Spirometry at dx and periodically; assess control q3–6 months; review exacerbations, oral steroid use, and rescue frequency.
- Prevention/Education: Written asthma action plan, inhaler teaching, trigger avoidance, vaccines (flu, COVID), smoking cessation.
- When to Refer/Escalate: ≥2 steroid bursts/year, hospitalization, diagnostic uncertainty, poor control despite Step 4 therapy.

DOTPHRASE # Rhinitis – Outpatient
- Dx: Chronic nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, congestion, sneezing, pruritus ± post-nasal drip); classify as allergic vs non-allergic (vasomotor, irritant, medication-induced, infectious, hormonal).
- Eval: Seasonal/perennial pattern, triggers (allergens, smoke, weather), meds (ACE-I, NSAIDs, topical decongestants → rhinitis medicamentosa), comorbid asthma/OSA/GERD; exam for turbinate edema, clear vs purulent discharge; consider IgE or skin testing if allergic suspected.
- First-line Tx: ***Intranasal corticosteroid /fluticasone ** daily (most effective monotherapy); proper technique emphasized (aim away from septum, daily use ≥2–4 wks).
- Adjuncts: Non-sedating oral antihistamine for itching/sneezing; **intranasal antihistamine** for breakthrough sx; saline irrigation PRN.
- Refractory/Specific: Add intranasal anticholinergic (ipratropium) for predominant rhinorrhea; leukotriene receptor antagonist if concomitant asthma; short course intranasal decongestant ≤3 days only.
- Avoid: Chronic topical decongestants (>3–5 days), sedating antihistamines when possible.
- Education/Prevention: Allergen avoidance, dust-mite covers, pet exposure counseling; assess adherence and technique at each visit.
- Refer: Persistent symptoms despite optimized therapy, red flags (unilateral obstruction, epistaxis, facial pain), or consideration of immunotherapy.
